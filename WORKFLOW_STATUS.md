# Workflow Status & Fixes Applied

## Issues Found & Fixed

### ❌ **Problems Identified:**

1. **4 redundant workflow files** running simultaneously
2. **Conflicting Changesets actions** in multiple workflows
3. **Missing permissions** for creating Release PRs
4. **Incorrect script references** in workflows

### ✅ **Fixes Applied:**

#### 1. Cleaned Up Workflows

- **Removed**: `main.yml` and `publish.yml` (redundant)
- **Kept**: `ci.yml` (comprehensive CI + release) and `release.yml` (manual releases)

#### 2. Fixed CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)

- Added proper permissions: `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write`
- Fixed script reference: `pnpm run changeset:publish` instead of `pnpm run release`
- Proper job naming and dependencies

#### 3. Fixed Manual Release Workflow (`release.yml`)

- Added missing permissions
- Fixed script references to use `changeset:version` and `changeset:publish`

## Current Workflow Structure

### `ci.yml` - Main CI/CD Pipeline

```yaml
Triggers: Push to main, PRs to main
Jobs:
├── test (all branches)
│   ├── Type checking
│   ├── Unit tests
│   ├── Build library
│   └── Build example
└── release (main branch only)
    └── Changesets action (creates Release PRs or publishes)
```

### `release.yml` - Manual Release

```yaml
Trigger: Manual workflow dispatch
Jobs:
└── release
    ├── Run CI checks
    ├── Create changeset
    ├── Version packages
    ├── Commit changes
    └── Publish to npm
```

## Why Release PR Wasn't Created

The issue was likely:

1. **Missing permissions** - Fixed by adding `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write`
2. **Wrong script reference** - Fixed by using `changeset:publish` instead of `release`
3. **Multiple conflicting workflows** - Fixed by removing redundant files

## Next Steps

1. **Push these fixes** to trigger the corrected workflow
2. **Verify Release PR creation** with existing changesets
3. **Test the full flow** by merging a Release PR

## Expected Behavior Now

With pending changesets in `.changeset/`:

- Push to main → CI runs → Release PR created automatically
- Merge Release PR → Package published to npm automatically

The workflow should now work correctly! 🚀
