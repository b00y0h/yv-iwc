# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The YouVisit IWC React component library currently uses CSS modules for styling, which doesn't work when the library is consumed as an npm package in Next.js applications. The component needs a styling architecture that provides default styles that work out-of-the-box while allowing consumers to customize the appearance through assignable class names. The solution should follow best practices for React component library styling without over-engineering.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer consuming the YouVisit IWC library, I want the component to render with proper default styling immediately after installation, so that I don't need to write any CSS to get a functional, good-looking component.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the YouVisit IWC component is imported and used in any React application THEN the component SHALL display with complete default styling
2. WHEN the component is used without any custom CSS THEN all visual elements SHALL be properly styled and positioned
3. WHEN the library is installed via npm THEN no additional CSS imports or configuration SHALL be required for basic functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer consuming the YouVisit IWC library, I want to customize the appearance of specific parts of the component, so that I can match my application's design system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide custom class names to the component THEN the component SHALL accept and apply those class names to the appropriate elements
2. WHEN I apply custom CSS to the provided class names THEN my styles SHALL override the default styles appropriately
3. WHEN I want to style different parts of the component THEN the component SHALL expose separate class name props for each customizable element
4. IF I don't provide custom class names THEN the component SHALL fall back to default styling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a library maintainer, I want a styling solution that works across different React frameworks and build systems, so that the component is universally compatible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component is used in Next.js applications THEN the styling SHALL work correctly
2. WHEN the component is used in Create React App applications THEN the styling SHALL work correctly
3. WHEN the component is used in Vite-based applications THEN the styling SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN the component is built and published as an npm package THEN the styles SHALL be included in the distribution

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a library maintainer, I want the styling architecture to be maintainable and follow React component library best practices, so that the codebase remains clean and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the styling solution THEN it SHALL follow established patterns for React component libraries
2. WHEN adding new styled elements THEN the pattern SHALL be easily repeatable
3. WHEN reviewing the code THEN the styling approach SHALL be simple and not over-engineered
4. WHEN building the library THEN the styling solution SHALL integrate seamlessly with the existing build process
